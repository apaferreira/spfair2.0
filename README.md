# spfair2.0 Food/No food - deep learning classifier

At the Skip's app people can take a picture of the delivered food (as we all do at restaurants).

One question comes: The taken picture is a proper food photo or a nude picture?

I am proposing a feature to automaticly classify the picture.

This task can not be done on the cloud. This processing have to be done locally on the app. 

The advantages of local processing are: 
    - do not wasting processing on the cloud, this task do not need to be scaled up.
    - save storage and data traffic on the cloud once only valid food image will be uploaded
